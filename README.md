# Discord Username Checker üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Discord Username Checker**, a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to help you find available usernames on Discord. This tool consists of two main components: a **Wordlist Generator** and a **Username Checker**. Whether you're looking to generate random usernames or check their availability, this tool has got you covered.

---

## Features üåü

- **Wordlist Generator**: Generate random usernames based on your desired length and quantity.
- **Username Checker**: Check the availability of usernames from a `wordlist.txt` file.
- **Custom Delay**: Set a delay between checks to avoid Discord's rate limits.
- **Discord Webhook Integration**: Receive notifications for available usernames directly on your Discord server.
- **No Valid.txt File with Webhook**: If you use a webhook, the tool will not create a `valid.txt` file, as all valid usernames will be sent to your Discord.

---

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. **Wordlist Generator** (`wordlist_generator.py`)
This script generates random usernames for you to check. Here's how to use it:
1. Run the `wordlist_generator.py` file.
2. **Enter the Length of Usernames**: Specify the maximum length of the usernames you want to generate.
3. **Enter the Number of Usernames**: Specify how many random usernames you want to generate.
4. **Generate the Wordlist**: After hitting enter, the script will create a new file containing the generated usernames.
5. **Copy to `wordlist.txt`**: Open the generated file, copy all the usernames, and paste them into the `wordlist.txt` file.

### 2. **Username Checker** (`checker.exe`)
This tool checks the availability of usernames from the `wordlist.txt` file. Here's how to use it:
1. Run the `checker.exe` file.
2. **Set the Delay**: The tool will ask for a delay between checks. The **recommended safe delay is 20 seconds** to avoid Discord's rate limits. Going below this may cause glitches.
3. **Discord Webhook (Optional)**: If you want to receive notifications for available usernames on Discord, enter your webhook URL. If you leave it empty, the tool will save valid usernames in a `valid.txt` file.
   - **Note**: If you use a webhook, the tool will **not create a `valid.txt` file**. All valid usernames will be sent directly to your Discord.
4. **Start Checking**: Hit enter, and the tool will begin checking the usernames in `wordlist.txt`.

## Virus Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
The `checker.exe` file may be flagged by antivirus software (e.g., Windows Defender) because it is built using **PyInstaller**, a tool that packages Python scripts into executable files. PyInstaller often triggers false positives due to the way it bundles dependencies. To resolve this:
1. **Allow the File**: Add `checker.exe` to your antivirus exceptions list.
2. **Temporarily Disable Antivirus**: If needed, temporarily disable your antivirus to run the tool.

## Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of Discord's rate limits. Setting a delay below 20 seconds may cause glitches or errors.
- **Webhook Recommended**: Using a webhook is recommended, as it ensures you receive all valid usernames directly on Discord without relying on a `valid.txt` file.
- **Antivirus Flagging**: The tool may be flagged by antivirus software due to PyInstaller. Follow the steps above to resolve this issue.
